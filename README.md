#working with Pandas
Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes the following data.
As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

I did the the following transformations on data to obtain District summary

Calculate the total number of unique schools
Calculate the total number of students
Calculate the total budget 
Calculate the average (mean) math score 
Calculate the average (mean) reading score 
Calculate the percentage of students who passed math 
Calculate the percentage of students who passed reading
Calculate the percentage of students that passed both math and reading 
Created a new DataFrame for the above calculations called district_summary

To know highest performing schools by percentage of overall passing I did:

Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order 
Save the results to a DataFrame called top_schools
